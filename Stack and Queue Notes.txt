Stack and Queue using python list

Stack :- It is a special linear data structure called LIFO(Last In First Out),it has only end, that is called top
       - insertion and deletion takes place only top.
       - The insertion operation of stack is called PUSH.
       - The deletion operation is called is called POP.

       ALGORITHM FOR PUSH OPERATION

       Step 1: STRAT
            2: val=input("Enter the value to be added in stack")
            3: stack.append(val)
            4: top = top+1
            5: end
            Note:- for loop is not used,while loop is used


        ALGORITHM FOR POP OPERATION

       Step 1: STRAT
            2: slen = len(stack)
            3: if slen<=0:
            4: print "stack is empty"
            5: else
            6: val = 
            5: end
            Note:- for loop is not used,while loop is used
