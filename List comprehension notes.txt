List comprehension - an efficient way of creating a list

lst=[2,4,6,8,10]

------------
lst=[]
for i in range(1,6):
    lst.append(i*2)
------------
lst=[i*2 for i in range(1,6)] # This is list comprehension
--------------------------

List comprehension is a concise description of a list that shortlands the list creating for loop in the form of single statement.

ADVANTAGES OF List comprehension:-
1) Code reduction- a code of three of more line reduces to 1 line
2) Faster code processing - a) python will allocate the list's memory first, before the adding the elements to it insted of having to resize on runtime
                            b) Also, call to append() function get avoided, reducing funtion overhead time which may be cheap but add up.
