QUEUE
-------------
qUEUE IS A SPECIAL LINEAR DATAstructure called FIFO(first in first out). like stack a queue also consist of a sequence of items and there are restrictions on how items can be added to and remove from the list.

A Quey has two ends
1) front- the end from which deletion takes place
2)rear- the end from which insertion takes place


IMPLEMENTATION OF QUEUE AS A LIST

the basic operation carried out by a queue as alist are

a) creating a queue using list
2) inserting an elements in queue
c) checking for empty queue
d) traversal/displaying queue items


a) creating a queue using list
    the syntax
    Queue=list() or Queue=[]

2) Algorithm for inserting an elements in queue
    1. START
    2. element = input("Enter the element to be added in queue:")
    3. queue.append(elements)
    4. STOP

c) Algorithm to checking for empty queue and also for deleting elements from queue
    1. START
    2. if Queue==[]
          print("QUEUE is empty")
          go to step4
    3. element=Queue.pop(0)
    4. STOP
